## Favorite CPSC120 Labs
* Lab 1

  This is one of my favorite labs because this is where we all started so it was fun making the first lab.  At first look this looked a little hard but now looking back at it the lab is super easy.  This lab is what started it all and I was able to find it fun. 

* Lab 5, part 1

  This is my second favorite lab because it was fun and had the challenge to work with multiple files.  We had rectangle_area.cc which was the main file then we had another file named rectangle_area_functions.cc which in there held the functions that were used in the main file. Got to learn modular programming which I found interesting and is a big part of our programming. 

* Lab 12, part 1

  Although this one was a more challenging lab I had to put this as one of my favorites because I had never coded something like this before.  I was able to make a gif out of this and learned something new. For example something new I used was the graphicsmagick to create a series of images!
